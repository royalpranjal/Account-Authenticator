# Account-Authenticator
Account Authenticator for Android to store sensitive information in the OS using _Account_ _Manager_

The app is just a model to demonstrate the working of a custom account authenticator. 

The databse used here is a local one (Realm) but in reality, we'll be using API endpoints for registration/sign in.

On successful execution, you'll be able to see the app under Settings->Account in Android.

#### How to use?
